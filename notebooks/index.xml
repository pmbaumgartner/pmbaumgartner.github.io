What&amp;rsquo;s in this notebook? The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is helpful in evaluating model performance, especially since Area Under the Curve (AUC ROC) has a several friendly interpretations. I use ROC curves in evaluating models I have to explain the model performance to non-technical folks. I was reading through Machine Learning: The Art and Science of Algorithms that Make Sense of Data and stumbled upon this nice visual and interpretation of ROC (tied to AUC):</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s in this notebook? Biclustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that clusters both the rows and columns. This notebook contains a workflow for completing biclustering in a network analysis context as well as a clean export of the data to an excel spreadsheet.</description>

      <title>Dimension Reduction with TSNE and Bokeh Scatterplot</title>

What&amp;rsquo;s in this notebook? This is a workflow I use often in data exploration. TSNE gives a good representation of high-dimensional data, and Bokeh is helpful in creating a simple interactive plots with contextual info given by colors and tooltips.
This workflow has been extremely helpful for:
 text analytics/NLP tasks if text data is passed through a TfidfVectorizer or similar from scikit-learn understanding word2vec or doc2vec vectors by passing them to TSNE getting an idea of separability in doing prediction / classification by passing the outcome variable to bokeh  This example uses the Australian atheletes data set, which contains 11 numeric variables.</description>
